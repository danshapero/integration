# integration

This is my (probably foolish) attempt to formalize the Riemann integral using the proof assistant [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).
The definition I have for a partition is taken from [this thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/formalizing.20definitions.20for.20real.20analysis) on the Lean community Zulip chat.
